@article{Gal2009,
	Abstract = {The objectives of this paper are to define and classify different types of errors and artefacts that can appear in the process of developing an agent-based model, and to propose activities aimed at avoiding them during the model construction and testing phases. To do this in a structured way, we review the main concepts of the process of developing such a model -- establishing a general framework that summarises the process of designing, implementing, and using agent-based models. Within this framework we identify the various stages where different types of errors and artefacts may appear. Finally we propose activities that could be used to detect (and hence eliminate) each type of error or artefact.},

@article{Izquierdo2009,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assist researchers in understanding the dynamics of simulation models that have been implemented and can be run in a computer, i.e. computer models. To do that, we start by explaining (a) that computer models are just input-output functions, (b) that every computer model can be re-implemented in many different formalisms (in particular in most programming languages), leading to alternative representations of the same input-output relation, and (c) that many computer models in the social simulation literature can be usefully represented as time-homogeneous Markov chains. Then we argue that analysing a computer model as a Markov chain can make apparent many features of the model that were not so evident before conducting such analysis. To prove this point, we present the main concepts needed to conduct a formal analysis of any time-homogeneous Markov chain, and we illustrate the usefulness of these concepts by analysing 10 well-known models in the social simulation literature as Markov chains. These models are:

*	Schelling's (1971) model of spatial segregation
*	Epstein and Axtell's (1996) Sugarscape 
*	Miller and Page's (2004) standing ovation model
*	Arthur's (1989) model of competing technologies
*	Axelrod's (1986) metanorms models
*	Takahashi's (2000) model of generalized exchange 
*	Axelrod's (1997) model of dissemination of culture
*	Kinnaird's (1946) truels 
*	Axelrod and Bennett's (1993) model of competing bimodal coalitions 
*	Joyce et al.'s (2006) model of conditional association

In particular, we explain how to characterise the transient and the asymptotic dynamics of these computer models and, where appropriate, how to assess the stochastic stability of their absorbing states. In all cases, the analysis conducted using the theory of Markov chains has yielded useful insights about the dynamics of the computer model under study.},

@inproceedings{Axtell2001,
	Abstract = {The effects of distinct agent interaction and activation structures are compared and contrasted in several multi-agent models of social phenomena. Random graphs and lattices represent two limiting kinds of agent interaction networks studied, with so-called small-world networks being an intermediate form between these two extremes. A model of retirement behavior is studied with each network type, resulting in important differences in key model outputs. Then, in the context of a model of multi-agent firm formation it is demonstrated that the medium of interactionwhether through individual agents or through firmsaffects the qualitative character of the results. Finally, alternative agent activation schedules are studied. In particular, two activation modes are compared: (1) all agents being active exactly once each period, and (2) each agent having a random number of activations per period with mean 1. In some models these two regimes produce indistinguishable results at the aggregate level, but in certain cases the differences between them are significant.},
